This repository is a Python Flask application. It uses Poetry for dependency management.

Any Python commands must be prefixed with "poetry run" so that they execute within the virtual environment created by Poetry.

All code should pass linters:

poetry run black workspace_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run flake8 workspace_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run pylint workspace_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run mypy --strict --scripts-are-modules workspace_onboarding_ux.py
